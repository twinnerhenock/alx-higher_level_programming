# Python - Object-relational mapping

In this project,  I learned how object-relational mapping is used for database scripting. I became familiar using mysql db and sql alchemy to query, create, edit and delete tables in mysql.

## Tasks 

* List all states in a database
* Filter states by user to display all values matching a given name in the states table.
* Display all values matching a given name in the states table
* List all values ordered by ascending
* List all state objects from a database  sorted by ascending
* Print the first state object from a database ordered by ID
* use sql-alchemy to list all state object that contain a given letter in a database
* Use sql-alchemy to print id and state object with a matching name that passed as argument to the database.
